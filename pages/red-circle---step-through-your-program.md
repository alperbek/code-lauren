## Step through your program

A program is a list of instructions given to a computer.

Click the rewind button <img src="/resources/images/rewind-bow.png" width="18" /> at the top of the screen.  This rewinds the program to its beginning.

We'll use the player controls to run your program step by step.  This page will explain what is happening at each step.

Notice that `200` is highlighted in gray.  This is the first instruction of the program.  Isn't it weird that the computer has started in the middle of the first line of the program? Well, in order to draw a circle, the computer needs to know where and how big to draw it.  It starts with `200`, the x-coordinate of the place where the circle will be drawn on the screen.

Click the step forwards button <img src="/resources/images/step-forwards-bow.png" width="10" /> and `300` is now highlighted.  This is the y-coordinate of the circle.

Click <img src="/resources/images/step-forwards-bow.png" width="10" /> and `100` is highlighted. This is radius of the circle.

Notice that nothing has been drawn, yet.  The computer has the information it needs, but there is more work to do first.

Click <img src="/resources/images/step-forwards-bow.png" width="10" /> and `make-circle` is highlighted.  This instruction means "get the action called `make-circle`".  An action is a list of instructions (Like a program? Yes! This will make more sense soon.)

Click "Stepping through make-circle" to continue.
