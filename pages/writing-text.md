## Writing text


You can write text on the screen with the `write` action.  Type in this code:

```
write("hi" 200 200 "black")
```

Using the `write` action is a super-easy way to look at the number that a name is pointed at.  For example, type in this code:

```
top-dist: 200

write(top-dist 200 200 "black")
```

Why would you want to do this? You'll see!
