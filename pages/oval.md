## Draw an oval <div class="top-nav">[←](#home) &nbsp; [→](#ovals)</div>

Let's write your first program.

Delete all the code in the area on the left.  Type in the code below.

```
draw-oval(100 200 30 40 "filled" "blue")
```

Do you see a blue oval?

### Make the oval an outline

Try changing `"filled"` to `"unfilled"`.

### Change the position and size

Try changing the numbers. They describe:

1. How far to the right the oval is.
2. How far down the oval is.
3. How wide wide the oval is.
4. How tall the oval is.

Which one is which?

Do the numbers that describe the position of the oval indicate its middle or top left?

### ←[Previous](#home) <div class="next">[Draw lots of ovals](#ovals)→</div>
