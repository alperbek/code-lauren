## Fixing code using the player controls

How to fix a problem in your code:

1. Find the cause of the problem.
2. Change your code to remove the cause of the problem.

The player controls can help you with this process.  In the short video below, I write a very simple program that has a problem.  I run my program slowly using the player controls.  This slow running lets me see what causes the problem, and how to fix it.
