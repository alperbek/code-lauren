## Moving two shapes together

### Draw a circle

Starting from the code in the previous lesson, add another line of code that is `100` from the left of the screen, `200` from the top, is `100` wide and `100` tall.  If you can't remember how to draw a circle, search for `draw a circle` in the search box above.

Now make the circle move along with the rectangle.

If you're not sure how to do this, look at how the line of code for the rectangle.  It uses a label - `left-dist`, or something like that - to dictate how far from the left of the screen to draw the rectangle.  This number increases each time through the `forever`.  The line of code is inside the `forever` so that it is run many times, each time with a different `left-dist`.  You can use the same approach to move your circle.

If you're still unsure, use the player controls at the top ([more info](#fixing-code-using-the-player-controls)) to run the program that moves the rectangle step by step.
