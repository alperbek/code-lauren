## Write text

You can write text on the screen with the `write` action.  Delete all the code on the left. Type in this code:

```
write("hi" 200 200 "black")
```

Using the `write` action is a super-easy way to look at the number that a name is pointed at.  For example, change the code on the left so it looks like this:

```
number: 103

write(number 200 200 "black")
```

Why would you want to do this? You'll see!
