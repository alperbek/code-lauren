## Draw an oval

Let's write your first program.

Delete all the code in the area on the left.  Type in the code below.

```
draw-oval(100 200 30 40 "filled" "blue")
```

Do you see a blue oval?

### Make the oval an outline

Try changing `"filled"` to `"unfilled"`.

### Change the position and size

Try changing the numbers. They describe:

1. How far to the right the oval is.
2. How far down the oval is.
3. How wide wide the oval is.
4. How tall the oval is.

Which one is which?

Do the numbers that describe the position of the oval indicate the middle of the oval or the top left of the oval? To put the question another way, will this oval be half off the screen or fully visible?

```
draw-oval(0 0 100 100 "filled" "pink")
```

What about this one?

```
draw-oval(-50 -50 100 100 "filled" "pink")
```

Type in the code to find out!
