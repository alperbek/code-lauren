## Adding numbers <div class="top-nav">[←](#writing-text) &nbsp; [→](#naming-the-result-of-an-action)</div>

As well as drawing shapes, actions can be used for many other things.  For example: adding numbers. Type in this code:

```
write(add(1 2) 200 200 "black")
```

What happened?

The `add` action was given `1` and `2` and it added them.  `add` gave back the answer, `3`, to the `write` action which wrote it on the screen.
